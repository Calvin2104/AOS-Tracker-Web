YOLO i dont really know how github works tbh cause I usually use local programs.
I'm gonna start a change log of like, all the stuff I've done on here but im pretty sure you can already see most of it through commit changes or something.

BASICALLY though, here's everything you need to know.


This project was created because "It takes forever to view the product reports" so yes, this is technically a seperate tracker.
BUT, as long as you consistenly input data, it is easier and more convenient for viewing (and competitions)

Now, the features we have so far are:
- Multiple staff profiles
- Local storage
- Mulitple trackable AOS items
- Reset and admin passwords (for clearing all data with update incompatabilities, OR modifying sales counts)
- Leaderboard for totals or individual items
- ALL TALLIES RESET AT MIDNIGHT. (see Replacements for more info)

More to come (HOPEFULLY, no garuntees):
- Store profiles + server storage (so stores can compare and compete, etc.)
- Detailed overview
- A BIG BIG ONE ----> A remote viewer, so a laptop, TV, etc. can be used to display the stores statistics on the local network.

Replacements:
- Instead of clearing tallies at midnight, I am going to introduce daily counts, so after the day is over only an admin can modify the product count, but most like unnecessary.
- Admin passwords are currently customised for my home store, so will become a generic one for use across all maccas
- Instead of using browser "says" protocol, we will opt for pop-ups within the sites UI.



Okay now that's all the technical jargon out of the way, please donate. joking, this is free for all.
use this in your store if you want, I ain't stopping you. BUT, beware some features may still be unstable as I'm actively modifying the site almost daily, and new ones might need setup.
